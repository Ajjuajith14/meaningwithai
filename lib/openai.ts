    const prompt = `You are an expert educational AI assistant with 20+ years of teaching experience, specializing in helping children and teens (ages 6‚Äì18) learn English vocabulary through rich, engaging, and age-appropriate learning cards. For the word "${word}", generate a highly detailed JSON response following this structure :

1. **Word & Pronunciation**: Provide the exact word and its phonetic pronunciation (IPA-style, simple and child-friendly, e.g. /h…ôÀàpiÀê/). Add a short hint on how to say it (e.g. ‚Äúrhymes with‚Ä¶‚Äù).
2. **Part of Speech**: Clearly state the grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) with a brief explanation of what that part of speech means in simple terms.
3. **Core Definition**: A precise, dictionary-accurate definition (1 sentence if needed).
4. **True Meaning Note**: A confirmation sentence explaining that this meaning aligns with major dictionary sources.
5. **Child-Friendly Explanation**: A playful, engaging version of the definition tailored for ages 6‚Äì18, written as if teaching a curious student.
6. **Real-World Scenario**: A detailed and relatable mini-story (1 sentence) that shows where someone might encounter this word in school, at home, in sports, friendships, or daily life.
7. **Usage Examples**: Two distinct, creative sentences that show correct usage in very different contexts (make one casual/fun, the other academic/formal).
8. **Image Prompt**: A single, richly detailed cartoon-style illustration description. Include: characters (kids(1 to 3), animals, or objects), setting (playground, school, park, fantasy world), actions, and emotions ‚Äî all designed to clearly show the word‚Äôs meaning in a fun and memorable way.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important formatting rules:
- Output MUST be valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks).
- The "imagePrompt" field must always be one descriptive string, not an object.
- Explanations and examples should be long enough to be vivid but still easy to understand.

Example format:
{
  "word": "brave",
  "pronunciation": "/bre…™v/ (rhymes with 'wave')",
  "partOfSpeech": "adjective ‚Äî a word that describes someone or something",
  "definition": "Having or showing mental or moral strength to face danger, fear, or difficulty. A brave person does not let fear stop them from doing what is right or necessary.",
  "trueMeaningNote": "",
  "simpleExplanation": "Being brave means you do something even when you feel scared, like standing up for a friend or trying something new.",
  "realWorldScenario": "Imagine a child who is nervous about swimming in deep water but jumps in and tries anyway, or a student who speaks in front of the class even though their heart is racing. These are everyday moments of bravery.",
  "examples": [
    "The brave firefighter rushed into the burning house to save the puppy.",
    "She was brave enough to ask a difficult question in front of the entire school assembly."
  ],
  "imagePrompt": "A colorful cartoon scene of a young child standing tall with a slightly nervous but determined smile as they face a big, friendly-looking dragon in a park, while friends cheer from the background ‚Äî the scene shows courage, determination, and bravery."
